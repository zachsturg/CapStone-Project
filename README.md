# CapStone-Project
My final capstone project. Fish image classification using convolutional neural networks. Four classes of fish from the WildFish dataset were used for this work. Three models consisting of 3, 4, and 5 convolutional layer networks were constructed. Each was trained and compared on both 64x64x3 and 128x128x3 image sizes. Of these, the best performing model was the 4 convolutional layer trained on 128x128x3 data with an accuracy of 92%.
